</p>

This project leverages reinforcement learning and a Language Model (LLM) to train an advanced AI agent capable of playing the game of checkers. It integrates innovative techniques to improve training with action-space limitation, decision-making efficiency and gameplay performance.

## Key Highlights

- **Reinforcement Learning Agent:**
  - Trained using self-play and temporal difference learning.
  - Incorporates a deep Q-learning approach with neural network-based Q-value approximation.

- **Language Model Integration:**
  - The LLM dynamically limits the action space, enabling efficient decision-making.

- **Interactive Gameplay Interface:**
  - Built using Pygame for graphical visualization.
  - Supports both human and AI players.

- **Customizable Opponents:**
  - Train and play against random, minimax, or AI-based strategies.
